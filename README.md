## About The Project -In progress
Our team leveraged data from multiple sources ... We transformed datasets into GeoJSON and JSON files for dynamic data visualization, employing technologies such as Python, Flask, JavaScript, D3.js, Leaflet.js, and Chart.js to create an interactive dashboard.

Placeholder --> Our team retrieved data from multiple sources to observe social media and mental health across the United States and worldwide social media engagement. Datasets were transformed to GeoJSON and JSON files using Pandas dataframes. JavaScript, D3.js, Geomapping with Leaflet.js, and Chart.js were utilized to generate an interactive United States map with a dashboard on mental health care. Flask and Beautiful Soup were used to web scrape a current social media news article from  .gov, send scraped information to MongoDB, and render it on our html page.

## Project Instructions
- **Objective**: Tell a compelling story through data visualization, allowing users to interactively explore the data.
- **Requirements**: 
  - Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).
  - Include a unique JS library not covered in our course.
  - Ensure your data set comprises at least 100 records.
  - Implement user-driven interaction for a dynamic experience.
  
     -HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations
    
     -Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript plots
    
     -Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by JavaScript libraries,
       Python in Jupyter Notebook, or Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally
  - Aim for at least three distinct views in your final visualization.

## Topic Description

## Background
In today's world, with smartphones and unlimited data plans being the norm, social media has transitioned from a niche interest to an essential aspect of daily life for people everywhere. A Pew Research Center study reports 72.5% of the U.S. population now engages with social networks. On the positive side, social media provides a space for connecting with distant friends and relatives, finding like-minded communities, and maintaining relationships across physical distances. Conversely, excessive social media use has been linked to anxiety, depression, and decreased self-esteem.

The shift toward digital platforms became more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding in maintaining personal connections, supporting remote work and education, providing access to health information and services, and fostering community support and solidarity. However, this reliance on digital tools has also highlighted the digital divide and raised concerns about the long-term impacts on mental health. Strategies such as tailoring your social media experience to be more uplifting and finding healthy activities outside of social media are crucial for maintaining balance​ (The Jed Foundation)​.
